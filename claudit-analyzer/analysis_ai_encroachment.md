# Project Analysis: Creative Dependency Graph Simulator

## 1. Significant Decisions

*   **Initial CLAUDE.md Creation**: The first major decision was to create a `CLAUDE.md` file to guide future interactions, outlining common commands and high-level architecture.
*   **Technology Stack Choice (Bun, Vite, React, TypeScript)**: The user explicitly requested `bun` for dependency and build management, along with `TypeScript/Node` structures, which Claude interpreted as a React/Vite setup.
*   **First Visualization Approach (3D Force-Directed Graph)**: Based on `docs/prototype.md`, the initial implementation focused on a 3D force-directed graph using Three.js and D3-force-3d.
*   **Switching from Web Worker to Direct Simulation**: To debug persistent issues with entities disappearing, Claude decided to temporarily disable the Web Worker and run the simulation logic directly in the main thread.
*   **Refocusing Simulation Logic on Redirection**: After initial 3D visualization issues, Claude decided to rewrite the core simulation logic to emphasize "dependency redirection" and "transformation" rather than "entity elimination," aligning more closely with the "vibe phenomenon" described in `docs/background.md`.
*   **Transition to a New Visualization Approach (2D SVG Flow)**: Following user feedback that the 3D visualization was "incredibly abstract" and "no good," Claude made a significant decision to abandon the current 3D POC and create a "completely new visualisation POC" using 2D SVG to better represent the "specific dynamics" of the background document.

## 2. Mistakes

*   **Initial `bun` Command Not Found**: Claude attempted `bun init -y` without verifying `bun`'s installation, leading to a "command not found" error.
*   **Leva Control Panel Nested Structure Issue**: The initial `ControlPanel.tsx` used a nested object structure for `useControls` that `leva` did not recognize, causing runtime errors.
*   **Aggressive AI Impact in Simulation Engine**: The initial `calculateAIImpact` logic was too strong, causing entities to disappear instantly when sliders were adjusted.
*   **Incorrect `Vector3` Cloning**: `Vector3` objects within entities were not being properly cloned, leading to unexpected behavior and lack of updates in the 3D scene.
*   **Dependency Volume Reduction Issue**: The `dep.volume` was being multiplied by `source.health * target.health`, causing dependency lines to shrink and disappear prematurely.
*   **Missing Entity Lookup in `DependencyLayer`**: The `DependencyLayer` component failed to find source/target entities because the `dep.source` and `dep.target` properties were sometimes full entity objects instead of just their string IDs, leading to no lines being rendered.
*   **Arbitrary AI Threshold for Direct Connections**: The initial 20% AI threshold for direct connections was too high, making the transformation less gradual and visible.
*   **Ground Plane Submerging Entities**: The ground plane's Y-position was too high, causing some entities (like freelancers) to appear partially submerged.
*   **Dependency Line Rendering Issues (Multiple Attempts)**: Claude struggled to get the dependency lines to render consistently, trying `Line` from `@react-three/drei`, `QuadraticBezierLine`, and then reverting to `Line` with debug cubes, indicating a persistent challenge with 3D line rendering.

## 3. Milestones

*   **CLAUDE.md Created**: Successfully generated the initial `CLAUDE.md` file with project overview, tech stack, structure, and commands.
*   **Bun Project Initialized**: Successfully initialized the Bun project with `bun init -y`.
*   **`package.json` Configured**: Updated `package.json` with all necessary React, Three.js, D3, Zustand, and Vite dependencies.
*   **Dependencies Installed**: Successfully installed all project dependencies using `bun install`.
*   **Project Directory Structure Created**: Established the `src/components/{Visualization,Controls,Layout},simulation,store,data,types,utils` directory structure.
*   **TypeScript Configuration Setup**: Created/updated `tsconfig.json`, `tsconfig.node.json`, `vite.config.ts`, and `vite-env.d.ts`.
*   **Core Types Defined**: Created `entities.ts`, `simulation.ts`, and `index.ts` for type definitions.
*   **Initial 3D Components Implemented**: Created `SimulationEngine.ts`, `Scene.tsx`, `EntityNode.tsx`, `EntityLayer.tsx`, `DependencyLayer.tsx`, `simulationStore.ts`, `ControlPanel.tsx`, `MetricsPanel.tsx`, `simulation.worker.ts`, `initialState.ts`, `App.tsx`, `App.css`, `main.tsx`, and `index.html`.
*   **3D Scene Rendering (Initial)**: Achieved a state where entities (balls) and the control panel were visible, even if the simulation was buggy.
*   **Leva Control Panel Fixed**: Resolved the `leva` error, allowing sliders to be manipulated without crashing.
*   **Entity Persistence and Basic Transformation**: Fixed the simulation so entities no longer instantly disappear, instead showing size and color changes.
*   **Dependency Lines (Blue) Rendering**: Successfully rendered the initial blue dependency lines in the 3D visualization.
*   **Layer Labels Added**: Implemented `LayerLabels.tsx` to clearly label the three organizational layers in the 3D scene.
*   **Organization Sliders Functionality**: Made the "Organization" sliders (Risk Tolerance, Tech Literacy, Cultural Inertia) influence the simulation's AI adoption speed and resistance.
*   **Improved Metrics Panel**: Updated `MetricsPanel.tsx` to display more relevant information like traditional vs. direct connections, efficiency gain, and cost impact.
*   **New 2D SVG Visualization POC Created**: Successfully generated `FlowVisualization.tsx`, `FlowVisualization.css`, `flow.html`, and `flow-main.tsx` for a completely new 2D flow-based visualization.
