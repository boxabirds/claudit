# Subreport 4/21: Macscreencap

I am unable to access files outside of the project directory for security reasons. The path `/var/folders/b_/66g1274s7_xfw7x984g072s40000gn/T/tmpuvhq5_eh.txt` is outside of my allowed scope.

Please copy the file into the current project directory (`/Users/julian/expts/claudit/claudit-analyzer`) and I will be able to read it.
