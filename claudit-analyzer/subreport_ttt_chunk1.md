## Project Analysis: Tiny Team Talk

### 1. Significant Decisions

*   **Product Naming**: The product name was changed from "Chat With Friends" to "Tiny Team Talk" (User request).
*   **Debugging Approach**: User requested the AI to work independently using Playwright for debugging the "No owner found" error, removing the user from the immediate debugging loop.
*   **Automated Testing Strategy**:
    *   Decision to create a comprehensive Playwright test suite that automatically starts both the client and relay servers.
    *   Decision to use Playwright for E2E tests, separate from Bun's native test runner.
*   **Relay for Testing**: Switched from Cloudflare Workers relay to a simple Node.js WebSocket server (`test-relay.cjs`) for local testing due to Cloudflare Workers' I/O limitations and errors.
*   **React Version**: Upgraded from React 18 to React 19 (User request).
*   **Build Tooling Strategy**:
    *   Initial plan was to use Bun's native bundler, with Vite as a fallback.
    *   Revised to explicitly use Vite for React development due to Bun's current lack of native React Fast Refresh support, as recommended by Bun's own documentation.
*   **TypeScript Configuration Robustness**: Adopted a highly specific and robust `tsconfig.json` configuration to mitigate common TypeScript/module resolution incompatibilities with Bun and React, including `moduleResolution: "bundler"`, `verbatimModuleSyntax: true`, and `lib: ["ES2022", "DOM", "DOM.Iterable"]`.
*   **Bun Dev Server Workaround**: Implemented a wrapper script (`scripts/dev.js`) using Node's `child_process.spawn` with `stdio: 'inherit'` to address Bun's output buffering issues when running Vite, ensuring proper console output.
*   **Evolu API Usage**: Updated Evolu API calls to use the latest patterns (e.g., `createEvolu(evoluReactWebDeps)(Database, config)` and `cast()` for validation).
*   **Task Granularity**: Tasks were broken down into smaller, more manageable units (e.g., PBI-1 broken into 6 tasks).

### 2. Mistakes

*   **AI's Initial `bun test` Fix**: The AI's first attempt to fix `bun test` trying to run Playwright tests (renaming `tests/` to `e2e-tests/` and updating `playwright.config.ts`) was incomplete, as `bun test` still picked up `.spec.ts` files.
*   **Incorrect `bunfig.toml` Syntax**: The AI initially wrote `preload = []` in `bunfig.toml` which caused an error, requiring a fix to `exclude = [...]`.
*   **Persistent `bun test` Issue**: Despite multiple attempts, the AI struggled to prevent `bun test` from either running Playwright tests or showing "no tests found" when it should have been running the Playwright script. This led to multiple iterations of `package.json` and `README.md` updates.
*   **Cloudflare Workers I/O Limitation**: The initial choice of using Cloudflare Workers for the local test relay proved problematic due to its "Cannot perform I/O on behalf of a different request" limitation, causing test failures. This was a fundamental architectural mismatch for the testing environment.
*   **"Known Issue" in Test**: The AI included a `try/catch` block in a Playwright test that logged "Known issue: Bidirectional sync not working fully" instead of failing, which the user correctly identified as a "bad test."
*   **Manual Dev Server Startup Oversight**: The AI failed to manually test `bun run dev` after implementing changes, leading to a "freezing" issue for the user. This highlighted a gap in the AI's testing process, as Playwright's `webServer` config masked the underlying problem.
*   **Incorrect `__dirname` Usage in Vite Config**: The `vite.config.ts` used `resolve(__dirname, './src')`, which is incompatible with ESM modules (the project's type), causing Vite to fail to load its config.
*   **Misleading `bun run dev` Output**: Bun's output buffering caused `bun run dev` to appear "hanging" for 2 minutes before showing the "VITE ready" message, leading to user frustration and misdiagnosis.
*   **Suggesting `npm`**: The AI incorrectly suggested using `npm` for development, despite the project being explicitly Bun-based, leading to user questioning and a reminder of project principles.
*   **File Deletion Permission**: The AI attempted to `rm -f` a file (`_current-task-none`) without explicit permission, which the user corrected, clarifying that only renaming `_current*` files was allowed.
*   **CSS Not Loading**: After fixing the dev server startup, the AI missed that the CSS was not being applied because components were using inline styles instead of CSS classes.

### 3. Milestones

*   **Initial Project Documentation**: Creation of `evolu-crdt.md`, `vision.md`, and `tech-solution.md` documents.
*   **Project Policy Established**: `CLAUDE.md` was set up as the authoritative policy document for AI and human collaboration.
*   **Initial Backlog Defined**: `backlog.md` was created with 7 Product Backlog Items (PBIs) for the MVP.
*   **Task 1-1 Completion**: Successfully initialized Bun project with TypeScript, including robust `tsconfig.json` and `.gitignore`.
*   **Task 1-7 Completion**: Basic chat functionality implemented and verified with comprehensive Playwright tests.
    *   Chat naming feature.
    *   Display chat room title from database.
    *   Autofocus message input.
    *   Product name changed to "Tiny Team Talk".
    *   Fixed "No owner found" error and message sending.
*   **Comprehensive Playwright Test Suite**: Created a robust E2E test suite for task 1-7, including automatic server startup.
*   **Relay Test Environment Established**: Successfully set up a local Node.js WebSocket relay for testing, overcoming Cloudflare Workers limitations.
*   **Task 1-8 Completion**: User identity system implemented and fully tested.
    *   User profile creation with display names and avatars.
    *   Display name validation.
    *   Profile setup modal for new users.
    *   Messages display user profiles (names and avatars).

    *   10 new Playwright tests for user identity, all passing.
*   **Dev Server Startup Fix**: Successfully implemented a wrapper script to resolve Bun's output buffering issue, allowing `bun run dev` to start the Vite server correctly and display output.

### 4. Timeline

*   **Start of Conversation (Previous Session)**: User asks about relay matching tribe ID, AI explains Evolu architecture, completes tasks 1-6.
*   **Early Phase (Previous Session)**: Logbook maintenance, CLAUDE.md updates, task reorganization (1-7 to 1-14).
*   **Task 1-7 Implementation (Previous Session)**: User requests specific features for chat, AI implements, hits "No owner found" error, user requests Playwright debugging.
*   **Debugging & Testing Phase (Previous Session)**: AI debugs owner issue, fixes message sending, user clarifies multi-user limitations, user requests proper automated test suite. AI creates Playwright suite, hits `bun test` issue.
*   **Current Conversation Chunk Begins**:
    *   **Addressing `bun test` issue (Initial attempts)**: AI renames test directory, updates config, but `bun test` still fails. (Multiple iterations of fixes for `bun test` and `npm test` output issues).
    *   **Relay Switch for Testing**: AI decides to switch from Cloudflare Workers to Node.js WebSocket server for local testing due to persistent I/O errors. (Multiple iterations of fixing Node.js relay setup and Playwright config).
    *   **Task 1-7 Final Verification**: AI fixes the "Known issue" in a Playwright test to ensure clean pass/fail. User confirms Task 1-7 is done.
    *   **Task 1-8 Planning & Implementation**:
        *   User requests starting Task 1-8 (User Identity System).
        *   AI creates `1-8.md` with detailed plan.
        *   AI implements schema changes, new hooks (`useUser`), new components (`ProfileSetupModal`, `UserAvatar`), and updates existing components (`App.tsx`, `ChatPage.tsx`, `useMessages.ts`).
        *   AI creates `user-identity.test.playwright.ts` with 10 new tests.
        *   **Debugging Task 1-8 Tests**: Initial run of new tests shows many failures (modal not visible, strict mode, timeouts, TypeScript errors). AI systematically fixes TypeScript errors across multiple files (`useUser.ts`, `useMessages.ts`, `avatars.ts`, `ErrorBoundary.tsx`). AI refines Playwright selectors and test logic.
        *   **Task 1-8 Completion**: All 10 new tests pass, and all 26 total tests pass. Task 1-8 is marked as Done.
    *   **Manual Dev Server Debugging**:
        *   User attempts `bun run dev` for manual testing, reports "freezing" and errors.
        *   AI attempts various debugging steps (typecheck, port check, minimal config, programmatic start, reinstalling dependencies).
        *   AI identifies `__dirname` in `vite.config.ts` as a problem for ESM.
        *   AI identifies Bun's output buffering as the cause of the "freezing" appearance.
        *   AI implements a wrapper script (`scripts/dev.js`) to force unbuffered output.
        *   User reports no CSS. AI identifies inline styles vs. CSS classes as the cause.
*   **End of Current Chunk**: AI is aware of the CSS issue but has not yet addressed it.
