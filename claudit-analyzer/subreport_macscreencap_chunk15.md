# Subreport 15/21: Macscreencap

I can't access files outside of the current project directory.

Please copy the file into the current directory. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
cp /var/folders/b_/66g1274s7_xfw7x984g072s40000gn/T/tmp_9ing_t2.txt .
```

Let me know when you've done that, and I'll take a look.
