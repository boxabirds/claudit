# Subreport 8/21: Macscreencap

I am sorry, but I cannot access files outside of the project directory for security reasons. Please copy the file into the current directory and provide the new path.

You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
cp /var/folders/b_/66g1274s7_xfw7x984g072s40000gn/T/tmpqox44r5p.txt .
```

Once you've done that, please provide the new filename.
