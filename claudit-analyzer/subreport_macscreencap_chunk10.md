# Subreport 10/21: Macscreencap

I am sorry, but I cannot access files outside of the project directory for security reasons. Please copy the file into the current directory. For example, you can run the following command:

`cp /var/folders/b_/66g1274s7_xfw7x984g072s40000gn/T/tmp2r1ljlq7.txt .`

Once you have copied the file, please let me know and I will proceed.
