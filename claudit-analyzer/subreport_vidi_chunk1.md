# Project Analysis: Vidi Whiteboard Development

This document outlines the significant decisions, mistakes, milestones, and a chronological timeline of the Vidi whiteboard project based on the provided conversation history.

## 1. Significant Decisions

*   **Initial Technology Choice (Implicit)**: The project starts with an existing `index.html` that uses custom JavaScript and SVG for rendering, implying an initial decision to build from scratch or with minimal external libraries.
*   **Shift to Cytoscape.js for Arc Untangling** (2025-06-29T02:13:52Z): The user explicitly requests a new version (`cytoscape.html`) to leverage `Cytoscape.js` for "arc untangling," indicating a move towards a more robust graph visualization library.
*   **Initial Cytoscape.js Layout Strategy**: The assistant decides to use Cytoscape.js's built-in "force-directed layout and edge bundling capabilities" for untangling (2025-06-29T02:14:02Z).
*   **Custom Arc Untangling Algorithm in Cytoscape.js** (2025-06-29T02:28:22Z): Following user feedback that standard Cytoscape layouts were insufficient, the assistant decides to implement a "custom edge routing and force-directed adjustments" algorithm.
*   **Reversion to Original Connection UI in Cytoscape.js** (2025-06-29T02:32:10Z): The user rejects the Cytoscape.js default connection method (right-click context menu) and explicitly requests the "control point and drag approach provided in the original version."
*   **Shift to Vis.js for Network Methods** (2025-06-29T07:37:44Z): The user requests another major technology shift, moving to `vis.js` to explore its "various network methods as tools like repulsion, etc."
*   **Integration of Original Connection UI into Vis.js with Physics Toggle** (2025-06-29T08:24:34Z): The user again requests the original control point drag-to-connect UI for the `vis.js` version, adding a new requirement: "physics mode should temporarily turn off" during connection.
*   **Prioritizing Node Separation in Vis.js Physics** (2025-06-29T08:58:14Z): After persistent node overlap, the assistant agrees with the user's diagnosis that "arc length is a constraint that overrides node distance" and decides to adjust physics settings to "prioritize node separation over edge length."

## 2. Mistakes

*   **Initial `cytoscape.html` Dependency Errors** (2025-06-29T02:23:30Z): The first `cytoscape.html` failed to load due to missing `Cytoscape.js` plugin dependencies (`layoutBase` and `cytoscapeFcose not defined`).
*   **Cytoscape.js Connection Method Usability** (2025-06-29T02:24:36Z): The initial `cytoscape.html` used a right-click context menu for connections, which the user found "cumbersome" compared to the original's drag handles. This was a mismatch with user expectations.
*   **Cytoscape.js Untangling Ineffectiveness** (2025-06-29T02:28:16Z): The initial `cytoscape.js` implementation's untangling capabilities were deemed insufficient by the user ("none of the approaches do very well with basic untangling").
*   **Cytoscape.js API Incompatibility in `cytoscape-handles.html`** (2025-06-29T02:35:22Z): When implementing the custom drag handles, the assistant used outdated `Cytoscape.js` API calls (`cy.modelToRenderedPosition` and `cy.elementAt`), leading to `TypeError` and `ReferenceError`.
*   **Vis.js Node Overlap and Layout Jump on Connection Start** (2025-06-29T08:34:00Z): In `vis.html`, nodes were still overlapping, and initiating a connection caused a "jump from current layout to some weird scrunched view."
*   **Vis.js Invisible Node Movement and Incorrect Connections** (2025-06-29T08:43:07Z): A critical bug where nodes were "moving invisibly" leading to connections being made to the wrong target node. This was due to physics updates not being properly synchronized with visual rendering when physics was temporarily disabled.
*   **Persistent Vis.js Node Overlap** (2025-06-29T08:58:07Z): Despite previous attempts, node overlap continued, with the user correctly identifying that "arc length is a constraint that overrides node distance."

## 3. Milestones

*   **Git Repository Initialized and Linked** (2025-06-29T02:02:22Z): The local directory was successfully connected to the GitHub repository.
*   **`cytoscape.html` Created (Initial Version)** (2025-06-29T02:15:02Z): A new HTML file using `Cytoscape.js` with basic node operations, layouts (including force-directed), and a right-click context menu was generated.
*   **`cytoscape.html` Dependency and Initialization Fixed** (2025-06-29T02:23:51Z): Resolved `TypeError` and `ReferenceError` by adding missing `Cytoscape.js` plugin dependencies and correctly initializing the `fcose` layout.
*   **`cytoscape-advanced.html` Created with Custom Untangling** (2025-06-29T02:29:59Z): A new file was created featuring a custom force-directed untangling algorithm, a crossing counter, an optimized circular layout, and `cytoscape-edgehandles` for connections. All related todos were marked as completed.
*   **`cytoscape-handles.html` Created with Original Connection UI** (2025-06-29T02:33:44Z): A new file was created integrating the original drag-to-connect control point handles with `Cytoscape.js` rendering.
*   **`cytoscape-handles.html` API Issues Fixed** (2025-06-29T02:36:02Z): Resolved API compatibility issues (`modelToRenderedPosition`, `elementAt`) and coordinate conversion for new nodes, making handle dragging functional.
*   **`vis.html` Created with Comprehensive Physics Tools** (2025-06-29T07:39:16Z): A new file was created using `vis.js`, offering multiple physics solvers, adjustable physics parameters via sliders, and interactive tools like "Add Edge Mode," "Stabilize," and "Shake."
*   **`vis.html` Integrated Original Connection UI with Physics Toggle** (2025-06-29T08:27:25Z): The `vis.js` version was updated to include the original drag-to-connect handles, with physics automatically disabling during connection and re-enabling afterward.
*   **`vis.html` Node Overlap and Layout Jump Fixed** (2025-06-29T08:35:08Z): Addressed node overlap by adjusting physics parameters (`margin`, `springLength`, `avoidOverlap`, `gravitationalConstant`) and eliminated layout jumps by properly fixing node positions and disabling/re-enabling physics during connection.
*   **`vis.html` Invisible Node Movement and Connection Targeting Fixed** (2025-06-29T08:44:14Z): Resolved the invisible node movement and incorrect connection targeting by ensuring proper position synchronization when physics is disabled, using `physics: false` instead of `fixed: true`, and implementing a more reliable bounding box check for target nodes.
