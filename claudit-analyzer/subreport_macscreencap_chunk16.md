# Subreport 16/21: Macscreencap

I am sorry, but I cannot access files outside of the current project directory for security reasons. Please copy the file to the current directory so I can access it.

For example, you can run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
cp /var/folders/b_/66g1274s7_xfw7x984g072s40000gn/T/tmpv6klgue2.txt .
```

Once you have copied the file, please let me know, and I will be happy to help you with it.
