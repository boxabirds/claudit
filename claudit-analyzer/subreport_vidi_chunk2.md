# Project Analysis: vidi Whiteboard - vis.js Network

## 1. Significant Decisions

*   **Physics Solver Change (2025-06-29T08:58:22Z)**: Decided to switch the physics solver from `barnesHut` to `repulsion` and adjusted related parameters (`nodeDistance`, `springLength`, `springConstant`, `damping`, `stabilization.iterations`) to improve node spacing and prevent overlap.
*   **Node Margin Adjustment (2025-06-29T08:58:29Z)**: Increased node margins to 40 pixels on all sides to provide adequate space for connection handles.
*   **Custom Edge Routing (Initial Attempt) (2025-06-29T09:04:17Z)**: Decided to disable `vis.js`'s built-in smooth edges (`smooth: enabled: false`) to implement a custom edge distribution logic, aiming to replicate the original `index.html`'s even arc distribution.
*   **Pivot on Edge Routing Strategy (2025-06-29T09:05:21Z)**: Realized that `vis.js` does not easily support custom edge anchor points. Pivoted to a new strategy that leverages `vis.js`'s built-in smooth options (e.g., `curvedCW`, `curvedCCW`) and `roundness` to achieve visual separation of parallel and bidirectional edges.
*   **New Node Type: "Website" (2025-06-29T09:39:35Z)**: Decided to introduce a new node type that displays an editable URL input and a mini webpage preview. This involved creating an invisible `vis.js` node for physics and overlaying a custom HTML element.
*   **CORS Fallback for Website Previews (2025-06-29T09:44:54Z)**: To address CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) issues preventing direct iframe embedding of many websites, a fallback mechanism was implemented using external screenshot API services.

## 2. Mistakes

*   **Initial Edge Routing Approach (2025-06-29T09:05:21Z)**: The initial attempt to implement custom edge routing by disabling `vis.js`'s smooth edges and trying to control precise anchor points was deemed difficult or not easily supported by the library. This led to a pivot in strategy. The AI explicitly stated: "Actually, vis.js doesn't support custom edge anchor points easily. Let me try a different approach using vis.js's built-in edge options more effectively."
*   **CORS Issue with Website Previews (2025-06-29T09:44:46Z)**: The initial implementation of the website node's preview feature relied solely on iframes, which failed for many websites due to browser security policies (CORS, X-Frame-Options). The user reported this issue, prompting the AI to implement a workaround.

## 3. Milestones

*   **Improved Node Spacing (2025-06-29T08:58:48Z)**: Successfully configured physics options (solver, nodeDistance, spring properties) and node margins to achieve better node spacing and prevent overlap.
*   **Initial Custom Edge Distribution (2025-06-29T09:04:43Z)**: Added core functions (`processEdgeDistribution`, `getConnectionOffset`, `getBestConnectionSides`) to attempt custom edge routing.
*   **Dynamic Edge Distribution (2025-06-29T09:05:15Z)**: Integrated `processEdgeDistribution` to run when new edges are added, line styles are changed, or nodes are dragged, ensuring dynamic updates.
*   **Refined Edge Distribution Logic (2025-06-29T09:06:29Z)**: Implemented a more robust edge distribution strategy using `vis.js`'s smooth options to handle parallel and bidirectional edges by varying curvature.
*   **"Add Website" Button Added (2025-06-29T09:39:51Z)**: A new button was added to the toolbar for creating website nodes.
*   **Website Node Core Functionality (2025-06-29T09:40:33Z)**: Implemented the foundational JavaScript functions for website nodes, including creating the HTML overlay, loading previews, updating positions, and handling selection.
*   **Website Node Integration (2025-06-29T09:41:32Z)**: Fully integrated website nodes into the network, ensuring they participate in physics, can be connected, selected, and deleted, and their positions are synchronized with the `vis.js` network.
*   **CORS Fallback for Website Previews (2025-06-29T09:45:21Z)**: Successfully implemented a fallback mechanism using multiple screenshot API services to display previews for websites that block iframe embedding, making the feature more robust.
