# Project Analysis: Vidi Whiteboard Development - Consolidated Report

This document consolidates the significant decisions, mistakes, milestones, and a chronological timeline of the Vidi whiteboard project, merging information from all subreports.

## 1. Significant Decisions

*   **Initial Technology Choice (Implicit)**: The project began with an existing `index.html` using custom JavaScript and SVG, implying an initial decision to build from scratch or with minimal external libraries.
*   **Shift to Cytoscape.js for Arc Untangling** (2025-06-29T02:13:52Z): A major technology shift to `Cytoscape.js` was made to leverage its capabilities for "arc untangling."
*   **Initial Cytoscape.js Layout Strategy**: The assistant initially decided to use Cytoscape.js's built-in "force-directed layout and edge bundling capabilities" for untangling (2025-06-29T02:14:02Z).
*   **Custom Arc Untangling Algorithm in Cytoscape.js** (2025-06-29T02:28:22Z): Following user feedback on the inadequacy of standard Cytoscape layouts, a decision was made to implement a "custom edge routing and force-directed adjustments" algorithm.
*   **Reversion to Original Connection UI in Cytoscape.js** (2025-06-29T02:32:10Z): The user requested a return to the "control point and drag approach provided in the original version" for connections, rejecting Cytoscape.js's default method.
*   **Shift to Vis.js for Network Methods** (2025-06-29T07:37:44Z): Another significant technology shift occurred, moving to `vis.js` to explore its "various network methods as tools like repulsion, etc."
*   **Integration of Original Connection UI into Vis.js with Physics Toggle** (2025-06-29T08:24:34Z): The original control point drag-to-connect UI was again requested for the `vis.js` version, with the added requirement that "physics mode should temporarily turn off" during connection.
*   **Prioritizing Node Separation in Vis.js Physics** (2025-06-29T08:58:14Z): To address persistent node overlap, the decision was made to adjust physics settings to "prioritize node separation over edge length."
*   **Physics Solver Change and Parameter Adjustment** (2025-06-29T08:58:22Z): Specifically, the physics solver was switched from `barnesHut` to `repulsion`, and parameters like `nodeDistance`, `springLength`, `springConstant`, `damping`, and `stabilization.iterations` were adjusted to improve node spacing.
*   **Node Margin Adjustment** (2025-06-29T08:58:29Z): Node margins were increased to 40 pixels on all sides to provide adequate space for connection handles.
*   **Custom Edge Routing (Initial Attempt)** (2025-06-29T09:04:17Z): An initial decision was made to disable `vis.js`'s built-in smooth edges to implement a custom edge distribution logic.
*   **Pivot on Edge Routing Strategy** (2025-06-29T09:05:21Z): Due to limitations in `vis.js` for custom edge anchor points, the strategy pivoted to leveraging `vis.js`'s built-in smooth options (e.g., `curvedCW`, `curvedCCW`) and `roundness` for visual separation of parallel and bidirectional edges.
*   **New Node Type: "Website"** (2025-06-29T09:39:35Z): A new node type was introduced to display an editable URL input and a mini webpage preview, involving an invisible `vis.js` node with an overlaid custom HTML element.
*   **CORS Fallback for Website Previews** (2025-06-29T09:44:54Z): To overcome CORS issues with direct iframe embedding, a fallback mechanism using external screenshot API services was implemented.

## 2. Mistakes

*   **Initial `cytoscape.html` Dependency Errors** (2025-06-29T02:23:30Z): The first `cytoscape.html` failed to load due to missing `Cytoscape.js` plugin dependencies (`layoutBase` and `cytoscapeFcose not defined`).
*   **Cytoscape.js Connection Method Usability** (2025-06-29T02:24:36Z): The initial `cytoscape.html`'s right-click context menu for connections was deemed "cumbersome" by the user, failing to meet usability expectations.
*   **Cytoscape.js Untangling Ineffectiveness** (2025-06-29T02:28:16Z): The initial `cytoscape.js` implementation's untangling capabilities were insufficient, as reported by the user ("none of the approaches do very well with basic untangling").
*   **Cytoscape.js API Incompatibility in `cytoscape-handles.html`** (2025-06-29T02:35:22Z): When implementing custom drag handles, outdated `Cytoscape.js` API calls (`cy.modelToRenderedPosition` and `cy.elementAt`) led to `TypeError` and `ReferenceError`.
*   **Vis.js Node Overlap and Layout Jump on Connection Start** (2025-06-29T08:34:00Z): In `vis.html`, nodes continued to overlap, and initiating a connection caused an undesirable "jump from current layout to some weird scrunched view."
*   **Vis.js Invisible Node Movement and Incorrect Connections** (2025-06-29T08:43:07Z): A critical bug where nodes were "moving invisibly," resulting in connections being made to the wrong target node. This was attributed to physics updates not being properly synchronized with visual rendering when physics was temporarily disabled.
*   **Persistent Vis.js Node Overlap** (2025-06-29T08:58:07Z): Despite previous attempts, node overlap persisted, with the user correctly identifying that "arc length is a constraint that overrides node distance."
*   **Initial Edge Routing Approach in Vis.js** (2025-06-29T09:05:21Z): The attempt to implement custom edge routing by disabling `vis.js`'s smooth edges and trying to control precise anchor points proved difficult and not easily supported by the library, leading to a pivot in strategy.
*   **CORS Issue with Website Previews** (2025-06-29T09:44:46Z): The initial implementation of the website node's preview feature, relying solely on iframes, failed for many websites due to browser security policies (CORS, X-Frame-Options).

*   **`vis.html` Node Overlap and Layout Jump Fixed** (2025-06-29T08:35:08Z): Addressed node overlap by adjusting physics parameters and eliminated layout jumps by properly fixing node positions and disabling/re-enabling physics during connection.
*   **`vis.html` Invisible Node Movement and Connection Targeting Fixed** (2025-06-29T08:44:14Z): Resolved the invisible node movement and incorrect connection targeting by ensuring proper position synchronization when physics is disabled and implementing a more reliable bounding box check for target nodes.
*   **Improved Node Spacing in `vis.html`** (2025-06-29T08:58:48Z): Successfully configured physics options (solver, nodeDistance, spring properties) and node margins to achieve better node spacing and prevent overlap.
*   **Initial Custom Edge Distribution Functions Added** (2025-06-29T09:04:43Z): Core functions (`processEdgeDistribution`, `getConnectionOffset`, `getBestConnectionSides`) were added to attempt custom edge routing.
*   **Dynamic Edge Distribution Integrated** (2025-06-29T09:05:15Z): The `processEdgeDistribution` function was integrated to run dynamically when new edges are added, line styles are changed, or nodes are dragged.
*   **Refined Edge Distribution Logic Implemented** (2025-06-29T09:06:29Z): A more robust edge distribution strategy was implemented using `vis.js`'s smooth options to handle parallel and bidirectional edges by varying curvature.

*   **Website Node Core Functionality Implemented** (2025-06-29T09:40:33Z): Foundational JavaScript functions for website nodes were implemented, including creating the HTML overlay, loading previews, updating positions, and handling selection.
*   **Website Node Fully Integrated** (2025-06-29T09:41:32Z): Website nodes were fully integrated into the network, ensuring they participate in physics, can be connected, selected, and deleted, and their positions are synchronized.
*   **CORS Fallback for Website Previews Implemented** (2025-06-29T09:45:21Z): A fallback mechanism using multiple screenshot API services was successfully implemented to display previews for websites that block iframe embedding.
